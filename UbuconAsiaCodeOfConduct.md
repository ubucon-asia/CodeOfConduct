# Ubucon Asia Code of Conduct
*Draft document*

The goal of Ubucon Asia, as a part of the greater Ubuntu Community, is to connect people intersted in Ubuntu across the world under safe environment. To reach the goal, Ubucon Asia adopted this Code of Conduct and [Ubuntu Code of Conduct 2.0](https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct/2.0).

Both enforced to anyone participating Ubucon Asia event. All participants are expected to cooperate to ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## A safe environment where everyone is respected
Ubucon Asia is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for anywhere, anytime of the conference including every sessions and any online spaces. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

## Policies to make safe environment
Harassment includes but not limited to offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. On offlline, staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges. On online, contact staff with contact info that can be found on "Contact info" section or on our website.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
